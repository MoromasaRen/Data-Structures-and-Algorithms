Variation 1 - Computer Word / Bitmask (data type holding int value)
This is the most common and space-efficient way to implement a bit vector set. 
An unsigned char (or int) is used, and elements are added by setting the corresponding bit using the bitwise OR operator.
Max number of bits is determined by the data type:
char     :  8 * sizeof(char)
int      :  8 * sizeof(int)
long int :  8 * sizeof(long int)
